# ALX Backend Python

In web development, the backend is responsible for processing requests
from clients, retrieving data from databases, performing calculations,
and generating responses to be sent back to the client.

Python is a popular choice for backend development due to its
simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and
frameworks. Some commonly used frameworks for building backend systems
in Python include Django, Flask, and Pyramid.
